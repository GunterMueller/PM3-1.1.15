The Polytechnique Montreal Distribution of Modula-3

pm3 version 1.1.15 dated Tue Sep  5 17:16:07 EDT 2000

This distribution is based on the DEC SRC Modula-3 release 3.6. Local
enhancements by Louis Dubeau, Jerome Collin and myself (Michel Dagenais)
were added, and several packages (libraries, programs, and documentation)
from other sources were added as well. The online documentation may be
accessed before the build by pointing your favourite WWW browser to
intro/src/index.html.

This file is normally part of a source code + bootstrap distribution.
To compile the bootstrap program, and compile and install the Modula-3
source, the following steps are required.

- insure that you have the usual development tools (make, gcc, ar).

- check, and modify if needed, the template for your platform. This
  template determines where the Modula-3 programs, libraries and 
  documentation will be installed and used, as well as default options
  for various needed tools. Typically you only need to change the
  INSTALL_ROOT variable if the default does not suit you.
  The template is located in m3config/src/{LINUXELF, SOLgnu, NT386GNU...}.

- The file src/m3makefile is used in the following steps to build all the
  packages. By default, almost all the available packages are built.
  You may comment out some of these in src/m3makefile to save build time
  and disk space.

- run "make", which will execute the commands in Makefile. It will
  build bootstrap versions of "m3build" and "m3ship" and then use
  these programs to rebuild and install all the libraries and programs in
  the distribution.

  If you downloaded bootstraps for several platforms, the remaining 
  Makefile is the last one you downloaded. In that case, you can use 
  the correct platform specific Makefile as Makefile.PLATFORM 
  (e.g. Makefile.LINUXELF) and use it with "make -f Makefile.PLATFORM".
